1/ install firebase. 
2/ in the ngOnInit on the appcomponent, 
(because that is the first thing that runs)
Initialize firebase with the api key and the
domain which that api key applies (the domain is 
simply our database)
3/use getIdToken()  for obtaining the token, NOT getToken()  as shown in the next lectures.

(using a release of firebase above 5.0)
