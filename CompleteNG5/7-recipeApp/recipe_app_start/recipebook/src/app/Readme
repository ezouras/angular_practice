** firebase backend ***
1/ using a "get" and "put" didn't require an installation 
2/ using the user authentifcation - specifically when using firebase
the plan is to use SDK and so the following was installed:
> npm install --save firebase
and
>npm audit fix
3/ the sdk is configured on "onInit" in the appComponent
becuase that is what runs when the app starts. 

4/  use getIdToken()  for obtaining the token, NOT getToken()  as shown in the next lectures.

(using a release of firebase above 5.0)


in the home page. we display the 
1/ app-Header
2/ app-recipes
3/shoppint-list-app


App-recipes has two columns. 
1/ app-recipe-list. it goes thru the list of all recipes. has a button to add a new recipe
2/ app-recipe-detail which shows the details (name, description, ingredients) of a given selected recipe in the list. 
		has a drop down to 
				-edit the recipe
				-go to the shopping list. 
3/ shoping-list-app , first has the selector to display the shoping-edit. 
then shows the ingrdients to some recipe int he future sing the Ingredient model in the
shared folder. 


a. no way for "app-recipe-detal" to know which recipe is selected in "app-recipe-list"
