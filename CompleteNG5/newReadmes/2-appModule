1/ what is it?
components are used ot create web pages.
modules are used to bundle them.  you only have multiple modules if you
have larger applications.
What does your app have and use?

2/ like a component it, it's a type script class:
export class AppModule{

}
3/ you need to import NgModule:
import{NgModule} from `@angular/core';

4/ add needed angular information in the decorator:
@NgModule({
  declarations:-> register all components you create.  [AppComponents,addUsers,anyothercomponets]
  imports: -> if you create other modules. 
  providers:
  boostrap:-> tel angular what component to recognize when you start the app.
})

5/ anytime you create a new comonents, you must register the ecomponent in
the correct corresponding module.
  a/ this is done in the "declarations" array.
  b/ you also must import it at the top of the module:
    import{ addUsers } from './users/addUsers.component'
