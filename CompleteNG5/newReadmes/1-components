    import {Component} crom '@angular/core';

4/set some stuff up in the component decorator:
  component({
    selector:'app-<a-fitting-name>',
    templateUrl:`./viewUsers.component.html` //the html code.  bue sure to create his file. add somethin i t to maek sure it works.
    //or template: and define it here. YOU MUST HAVE A TEMPLATE. then use `literals` and write
    styles:[` can add styles inline as well. `]
  })

  5/ create component thru the cli:
  ng generate component <name>
  ng g c <name>
