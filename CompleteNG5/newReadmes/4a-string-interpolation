String INterpolation.
Simply add dynamicn content to the template.



    1. class:
        export class ServerComponent{
          serverId: number = 10;
          //name : type  = value;
          serverStatus: string = "offline";
          getServerStatus(){
          return "offline";
          }
        }
b/ template:
different ways to do it.  Restrictions:
  1. has to be, in the end a string.
  2. can't be multiline BUT it can be a ternary expression.

      <p>server with id {{serverId} is {{serverStatus}}
      //in the curly braces MUST be a string. Doesn't matter how you get to it.:
      <p>server with id {{someNumber} is {{serverStatus}}//some numbr works
      //because it can be easily turned into a string.
      or
      <p>server with id {{"im a string"}} is {{getServerStatus()}}
      //as long as the method i sdefined in the class and either returns a string,
      //or something that can be easily converted into a string.
