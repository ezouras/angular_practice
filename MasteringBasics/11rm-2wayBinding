model and data must always be in sync.
consider loginform:

2 properties in the view.
view: username
      password


2 properties in the model
class: public username
      public password.




if there is an update in the view,
the two variables in the model shoudl automatically
be updated.  if there is an update in the model
the view should be auotmatically updated.


You must add it to the app.module.ts
if you don't you get this message:
"Can't bind to 'ngModel' since it isn't a
known property of 'input'"


projectName-> src -> app -> app.module.ts
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

then add it to the imports array in the same module:


<input [(ngModel)]="name2" type="text">
<h2>{{name2}}</h2>

in js class:
public name2="";
