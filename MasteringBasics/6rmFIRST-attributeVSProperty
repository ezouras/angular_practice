know the difference between an HTML attribute
and a DOM property.

**** Attribute VS Property ***
Attributes = HTML.
Properties = DOM (Document Object Model)

Attributes initialize DOM properties and then they are done.
Attributes values cannot change once they are
initialized.

property values can change.

Why is this important for Property binding.
Because it initially seems like we are binding
to the attribute.  But we are not.  we are binding to the
DOM property and NOT the html attribute.



In the test.copmonent, you have an input element on the
dom.  when you bring up the project in the browser,

1. select the input so that it is caputred by
the chrome developer.
>$0.getAttribute('value');
$0=current element.  you should have the selected element.
it will show "Evie"
>$0.value
will also work.


NOW change the value from "Evie" to
"Jerry" in the input field.
running
$0.getAttribute("value") returns "Evie" NOT jerry.
but
$0.value returns "Jerry"


The ATTRIBUTE in the html document did not change.
but the value did change.
