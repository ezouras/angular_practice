Observables:
A sequence of items that arrive asynchronously over time.
HTTP  call - single item.
single item - HTTP response.

http response that arrives asyncrhonously is the observable.
but it is not in a format that can be used.
ie' you may need to create an employee array with the data. 


|source|-> convert -> |newspaper co| -subscribe-> house 1
                                     -subscribe-> house 2
                                      -subscribe-> house 3


source - information.
company asks source fro info.
the source sends info to the newpaper co.
convert info into newpaper format.
maybe a line of data needs to have a headline,
and a bodythat includes the one line.

newspaper sends the newspaper only to those
houses that have subscribed to the newspaper.

whatever the houses do with the newspaper is up to them.
they may read the news, they may make paper airplanes.

source -> like a web api or database.
service makes a request to the source.
the api or db responds with an observable.
