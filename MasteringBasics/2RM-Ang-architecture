1/ Modules.
First building block. angular apps are modular in nature.
An application is a collection of many individual modules.
Each module represents a different feature area of your application.
ie users module = related to users.
admin module - related to administrators.

at the end of the day, modules is a bunch of lines of code
that can be imported or exported.
every angular app has at least ONE root module also
called the "app" module.


2/ components
MOdules are made up of components and services.

component -controls a portion of the view.
comonent for navationa, one for the side bar.

All angular apps have at least one component called the
root component or the AppComponent.  the root component
is called the AppComponent.

All other ocmponents will be nested inside this root component.

Each component will contain:
  a/ HTML template
  b/ class - logic that controls the view.


3/ services
Module will also contain services.
Services is a class that contains the business logic of your
application.


Summary:
Angular app - one or modules.
Module - one or more components and services.
Components - html +class
Services - business logic.
modules interact and ultimately render the view of the browser.
