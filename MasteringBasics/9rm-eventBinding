Binding:

JS class--> Template

sometimes you need the dataflow in the other directions.

Template/html-> JS classes

from the template - like clicking or filling in data - > to the class.
put the event in parenthesis, and have it equal the event in the js class:
<button (click)="iWillClick()">


in class:
iWillClick(){
  console.log("Clicked and binded!");
}

you can send info about the event:
$event -> special word from angular:
onClick($event);


onClick(event){
event.doSomething
}

/** putting javascript inline **/
<button (click)="onTheFly='whooowah!'">click me!</h2>
<h2>{{onTheFly}}</h2>


from class:
public onTheFly="";
