Bind to the DOM Property  (see 6rmFirst)

Example:
  <input [id]="myId" type="text" value="Evie">
  you are binding to the id property of the input element.
  Hence.. property binding.

  [disabled]="isDisabled"
  or
  bind-disabled="isDisabled"

  isDisabled is a property in the class that can be either
  true or false.

  [disabled] is the input property name that is dependent on the
  value that is defined in the class. disabled is not defined
  in the class. it is a DOM property.

  *********

  you could just explicitly do it. so why use it?
  <input id="myId" type="text" value="Evie">

  both input elements have an id property that equals
  "myId". so why use it?


  there is a limitation in using interpolation.  that is where
  this comes in.

  <input disabled id="{{myId}}" type="text" value="Evie">
  using disabled automatically make the input value disabled.
  it doesn't matter if you set it equal to false, it is still
  disabled. in other owrds, this has no effect:

  <inpub disabled="false"...> --> doesn't do anything.
  <input disabled="{{false}}"--> still doesn't work.
  <input [disabled]="false" ..--> THIS DOES WORK!
