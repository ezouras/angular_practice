Used inside the components template.

mine data from the class to the template. 

Represented by double curly braces, wiht a property name inside.
{{someProperty}}

We are asking angular to evaluate the content inside the
curly braces and display the value when the component is
rendered in the browser.

you bind data from the class to the template.


WE want the user to be dynamically created in the test component.

in app.component


in the @component decorator in test.component.ts, you have the following line:
  template: '<h2> Welcome Evie!</h2>',


instead of "Evie" being hard coded, make it dynamic.
we add a property in the class of the compoennt and
set public name = "Evie"
then replace in the template "evie" that is hardcoded, to
{{name}}

you can use javascript inside the curly braces:
<h2>{{"Welcome " + name}}</h2>
<h2>{{name.length}}</h2><!-- java methods-->
<h2>{{name.toUpperCase()}}</h2>

you can create methods in the class, then call them in the template
using interpolation:
<h2>{{greetUser()}}</h2>

YOU CANNOT use assignments:
<h2>{{a=2+2}}</h2><!--this doesn't work.  assignments dont work-->
you CANNOT use global javscript variables.  the template is
NOT aware of the template javascript variables:
<h2>{{window.location.href}}</h2>

However, the class IS AWARE so you can assign this in the class
to a property then use the proerty in the temlate.
