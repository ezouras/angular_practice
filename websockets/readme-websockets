HTTP: half duplex

client 							server
		----- http request ---> 
       <----- http response----
pip install asyncio

       same connection. only goes one way. 
       you make a request. you get a response.

       huge overhead.  headers take up 300bytes
       each way.  not useful for something like
       high speed trading. 

 Websocket: full duplex

 		<------ exchanging messages--->
 		goes both ways at the same time. 

 		small overhead. 5 bytes of overhead. 


 1/ supported by all browsers. 
 2/ event based.  ie' what do I do if a message come in. 

 ****/// python websocket server //******
 1/ install websockets
 pip install websockets
2/ install asyncio
pip install asyncio
