Dependency Injection is a way to create objects that depend on other objects.

depdendent objects = the objects that depend on other objects ( the dependencies )
When an instance of an object is created, the injection supplies the dependent objects
to this new object instance.


components and services are classes.
the constructor is called when a new instance of the class (object) is created.

We specify dependencies in the constructor of our components.

*prior to angular 6.
You MUST specify the services in the providers:[] property of the
NgModule decorator.
