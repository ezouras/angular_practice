Quote.component:
https://blog.avenuecode.com/how-to-customize-your-angular-app-using-directives
1/ the class only defines a function that is binded to the template

2/ quote.component html page.
<pre appQuote
Where "appQuote" is the directive selector.

  a. we are using the "directives.mypoliticianquote"
  directive by  pulling it in in the tag.
  this is done by simply using the direcvies "selector" name:
  <pre appQuote
  Where "appQuote" is the directive selector.

  b. "polticianAuthor" and "politicianQuote" are @Inputs
  to the directive. meaning, thy will be defined by the
  template that calls it in.

  c. when using a function, the @Input proeprty needs to be
  explicitly binded. When you are just setting it to a value
  in the template (NOT something defined in the comonent)
  you don't need to explicitly bind it. If you remove the
  binding from "politicianPOsition" it will equal the string
  otherwise it will equal what is defined in the class.
